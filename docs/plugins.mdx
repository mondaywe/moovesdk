title: Plugins
---

GOAT plugins are extensions that enable your agent to interact with various blockchain protocols. 

Instead of having a generic function to execute arbitrary transactions, plugins provide specific tools for common protocols to **reduce the risk of hallucinations**.

## Key Benefits
- **Modularity**: Easily add or remove functionalities.
- **Reusability**: Leverage community-built plugins.
- **Customization**: Design plugins to meet the unique needs.

----

## Chain Compatibility
Plugins can be EVM/Solana specific or chain-agnostic. If a plugin is chain-specific it will fail to compile when being used with a wallet of a different chain.

See all available plugins [here](/chains-wallets-plugins#plugins).

----

## Plugin Architecture
Plugins implement the `Plugin` interface defined in the [core package](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/plugins/plugins.ts):

```typescript
/**
 * Plugin interface that can be chain-specific or chain-agnostic.
 * Defaults to WalletClient for chain-agnostic plugins.
 *
 * @param TWalletClient - The type of wallet client to support. Defaults to WalletClient for chain-agnostic plugins.
 * @param name - The name of the plugin.
 * @param supportsChain - A function that returns true if the plugin supports the given chain.
 * @param supportsSmartWallets - A function that returns true if the plugin supports smart wallets.
 * @param getTools - A function that returns the tools provided by the plugin.
 */
export interface Plugin<TWalletClient extends WalletClient = WalletClient> {
    name: string;
    supportsChain: (chain: Chain) => boolean;
    supportsSmartWallets: () => boolean;
    getTools: (wallet: TWalletClient) => Promise<Tool[]>;
}

```

Plugins get passed a [WalletClient](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/wallets/core.ts) interface that can be EVM/Solana specific or chain-agnostic.

The WalletClient abstracts the underlying wallet implementation and provides a common interface to:
1. Get wallet information
2. Sign messages
3. Send transactions

This allows plugins to:
1. Work with any wallet implementation that implements the WalletClient interface, from key pairs to smart wallets.
2. Focus on the specific communication with the protocol without worrying about handling transactions, message signing, etc. for each wallet implementation.

## Creating your own GOAT plugin
Building a custom GOAT plugin is straightforward. Below, we'll walk you through creating a plugin that signs messages with "BAAAA" üêê prefixed to them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the plugin interface">
  Start by defining your plugin using the [Plugin](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/plugins/plugins.ts) interface.

  Since we are just signing messages, we will create a chain-agnostic plugin that works both on EVM and Solana chains.

```typescript
import type { Plugin, WalletClient, Chain } from '@goat-sdk/core';

function baaaSigner(): Plugin<WalletClient> { // We use the WalletClient interface for chain-agnostic plugins
    return {
        name: "Sign Message with BAAAA",
        supportsChain: (chain: Chain) => ["evm", "solana"].includes(chain.type),
        supportsSmartWallets: () => true,
        getTools: async (walletClient: WalletClient) => {
            return [];
        },
    };
}
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tools to the plugin">
    The `getTools` method returns an array of tools that will be added to the agent.

    Tools have the following interface:
    <Note>
    It's important to note that the description uses `{{tool}}` to refer to the tool name. This is a placeholder gets replaced by the words action or tool depending on the adapter being used.
    </Note>
    ```typescript
    export type Tool<TResult = any> = {
        name: string;
        description: string;
        parameters: z.ZodSchema;
        method: (parameters: z.infer<z.ZodSchema>) => TResult | Promise<TResult>;
    };
    ```

    For our example, we will create a tool that signs a message with "BAAAA" üêê prefixed to it.

    ```typescript
    import { z } from "zod";
    import type { Plugin, WalletClient, Chain } from "@goat-sdk/core";

    export function signMessagePlugin(): Plugin<WalletClient> {
        return {
            name: "Sign Message with BAAAA",
            supportsChain: (chain: Chain) => ["evm", "solana"].includes(chain.type),
            supportsSmartWallets: () => true,
            getTools: async (walletClient: WalletClient) => {
                return [
                    {
                        name: "sign_message_baaaa",
                        description: "This {{tool}} signs a message with 'BAAAA' prefix",
                        parameters: z.object({
                            message: z.string(),
                        }),
                        method: async (parameters) => {
                            const originalMessage: string = parameters.message;
                            const prefixedMessage = `BAAAA${originalMessage}`;
                            const signed = await walletClient.signMessage(prefixedMessage);
                            return signed.signedMessage;
                        },
                    },
                ];
            },
        };
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the plugin to the agent">

    ```typescript
import { getOnChainTools } from '@goat-sdk/adapter-vercel-ai';
import { signMessagePlugin } from './your-plugin-path/signMessagePlugin'; // Path to your plugin

const wallet = /* Initialize your wallet client */;

const tools = getOnChainTools({
    wallet: viem(wallet), // or smartwallet(wallet), solana(wallet), etc.
    plugins: [
        signMessagePlugin(),
        // ...other plugins
    ],
});

// Prompt: Sign the message "Go out and eat grass üêê"
    ```
  </Step>

### Next steps
- Share your plugin with others!
- Open a PR to add it to the [plugins registry](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/plugins) in the [GOAT SDK](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat).
