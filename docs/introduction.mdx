## What is Goat üêê?
Goat üêê (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit) is an open-source framework for connecting AI agents to any onchain app.

**Problem**: 

Today, there are thousands of agents, built across 5+ frameworks (Langchain, Vercel's AI SDK, Eliza, etc) using multiple languages (TypeScript, Python).

These agents can connect to various wallets, but programming even a simple onchain action (sending tokens, using a DeFi protocol) requires rebuilding support for each combination of framework, language, and wallet provider.

**Solution**: 

Goat solves this by providing an open-source, provider-agnostic framework that abstracts away all these combinations.

**Write an onchain action once, and it works across all frameworks, wallets, and languages, supporting both Solana and EVM chains**.

### Key features
1. **Works Everywhere**: Compatible with Langchain, Vercel‚Äôs AI SDK, Eliza, and more.
2. **Wallet Agnostic**: Supports all wallets, from key pairs to Crossmint and Coinbase.
3. **Multi-Chain**: Supports EVM chains and Solana (more coming üëÄ).
4. **Customizable**: Use or build plugins for any protocol (Polymarket, Uniswap, etc).

### How it works
Goat plugs into your agents tool calling capabilities adding all the functions your agent needs to interact with blockchain protocols. 

High-level, here's how it works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the wallet you want to use">
  Each wallet will have their specific client, e.g `viem(wallet)` for EVM key pairs or `smartwallet(wallet)` for Crossmint smart wallets.
```typescript
const wallet = ...

const tools = getOnChainTools({
  wallet: viem(wallet),
})
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the plugins you need to interact with the protocols you want">
```typescript
const wallet = ...

const tools = getOnChainTools({
  wallet: viem(wallet),
  plugins: [
    erc20({ tokens: [USDC, PEPE] }),
    faucet(),
    polymarket(),
    // ...
  ],
})
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect it to the agent framework you want">
```typescript
const wallet = ...

const tools = getOnChainTools({
  wallet: viem(wallet),
  plugins: [ 
    erc20({ tokens: [USDC, PEPE] }), 
    faucet(), 
    polymarket(), 
    // ...
  ],
})

// Vercel's AI SDK
const result = await generateText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools,
    maxSteps: 5,
    prompt: "Send 420 ETH to ohmygoat.eth",
});
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
