title: Plugins
---

Goat plugins are modular extensions that enhance the functionality of your AI agents by enabling it to interact with various blockchain protocols.

The goal of plugins is to provide your agent with the **exact capabilities it needs** to interact with the blockchain.

Instead of giving it generic tools to execute arbitrary transactions, plugins provide **specific tools for common protocols to reduce the risk of hallucinations**.

## Key Benefits
- **Modularity**: Easily add or remove functionalities without altering the core library.
- **Reusability**: Leverage community-built plugins or share your own with others.
- **Customization**: Design plugins to meet the unique needs of your project or integrate with any protocol.

## Chain Compatibility
Plugins can be EVM/Solana specific or chain-agnostic. If a plugin is chain-specific it will fail to compile when being used with a different chain.

## Plugin Architecture
Plugins implement the `Plugin` interface which is defined as follows:

```typescript
import type { Tool } from "./tools";
import type { WalletClient } from "./wallet";

/**
 * Plugin interface that can be chain-specific or chain-agnostic.
 * Defaults to WalletClient for chain-agnostic plugins.
 */
export interface Plugin<TWalletClient extends WalletClient = WalletClient> {
    name: string;
    getTools: (wallet: TWalletClient) => Promise<Tool[]>;
}
```

Goat provides plugins with a [WalletClient](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/wallet.ts) interface that can be EVM/Solana specific or chain-agnostic.

The WalletClient abstracts the underlying wallet implementation and provides a common interface to:
1. Get wallet information
2. Sign messages
3. Send transactions

This allows plugins to:
1. Work with any wallet implementation that implements the WalletClient interface, from key pairs to smart wallets.
2. Focus on the specific communication with the protocol without worrying about handling transactions, message signing, etc. for specific wallet implementations.


## Creating your own Goat plugin
Building a custom Goat plugin is straightforward. Below, we'll walk you through creating a plugin that signs messages with "BAAAA" üêê prefixed to them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the plugin interface">
  Start by defining your plugin using the [Plugin](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/plugins.ts) interface.

  Since we are just signing messages, we will create a chain-agnostic plugin that works both on EVM and Solana chains.

```typescript
import type { Plugin, WalletClient } from '@goat-sdk/core';

function baaaSigner(): Plugin<WalletClient> { // We use the WalletClient interface for chain-agnostic plugins
    return {
        name: "Sign Message with BAAAA",
        getTools: async (walletClient: WalletClient) => {
            return [];
        },
    };
}
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tools to the plugin">
    The `getTools` method returns an array of Tools that will be added to the agent.

    Tools have the following interface:

    ```typescript
    import { z } from "zod";

    export type Tool = {
        name: string; // The name of the tool,
        description: string; // The description of the tool
        parameters: z.ZodSchema; // The parameters schema of the tool
        method: (parameters: z.infer<z.ZodSchema>) => string | Promise<string>; // The method that will be called with the parameters
    };
    ```

    For our example, we will create a tool that signs a message with "BAAAA" üêê prefixed to it.

    ```typescript
    import { z } from "zod";
    import type { Plugin, WalletClient } from "@goat-sdk/core";

    export function signMessagePlugin(): Plugin<WalletClient> {
    return {
        name: "Sign Message with BAAAA",
        getTools: async (walletClient: WalletClient) => {
            return [
                {
                    name: "sign_message_baaaa",
                    description: "Signs a message with 'BAAAA' prefix",
                    parameters: z.object({
                        message: z.string(),
                    }),
                    method: async (parameters) => {
                        const originalMessage: string = parameters.message;
                        const prefixedMessage = `BAAAA${originalMessage}`;
                        const signed = await walletClient.signMessage(prefixedMessage);
                        return signed.signedMessage;
                    },
                },
            ];
        },
    };
}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the plugin to the agent">

    ```typescript
import { getOnChainTools } from '@goat-sdk/adapter-vercel-ai';
import { signMessagePlugin } from './your-plugin-path/signMessagePlugin'; // Path to your plugin

const wallet = /* Initialize your wallet client */;

const tools = getOnChainTools({
    wallet: viem(wallet), // or smartwallet(wallet), solana(wallet), etc.
    plugins: [
        signMessagePlugin(),
        // ...other plugins
        ],
    });

    // Prompt: Sign the message "Go out and eat grass üêê"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your plugin">
    If you want to share your plugin with others, you can publish it to npm or any other package manager!

    If you want your plugin to be published through the Goat SDK, please open a PR to add it to the [plugins registry](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/plugins).
