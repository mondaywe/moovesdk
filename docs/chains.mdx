GOAT aims to support as many chains as possible. If your chain is not supported you can open a PR to add it.

## PR to support a new chain
Here are the changes you need to make to support a new chain:

<Steps>
<Step>
Add your chain to the `chain.ts` file in the [core package](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/wallets/chain.ts).

```typescript
/**
 * @param type - "evm" or "solana", extend this union as needed (e.g., "sui")
 * @param id - Chain ID, optional for EVM
 */
export type Chain = {
    type: "evm" | "solana" | "aptos" | "chromia" | "my-awesome-chain";
    id?: number; // optional for EVM
};
```
</Step>

<Step>
In the same file, update the `getChainToken` function to return the token for your chain.

```typescript
export function getChainToken(chain: Chain): ChainToken {
    //...
    case "my-awesome-chain":
        return {
            symbol: "AWESOME",
            name: "Awesome Token",
            decimals: 13,
        };
    //...
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
Create a new file in the [wallets](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/wallets) directory with the name of your chain (e.g. `my-awesome-chain.ts`). 
In it you will define the interface for your chain's wallet client which will extend the `WalletClient` interface defined in the [core package](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/core/src/wallets/core.ts).

WalletClient only includes the methods that are supported by all chains such as:
1. getAddress
2. getChain
3. signMessage
4. balanceOf

```typescript
export interface MyAwesomeChainWalletClient extends WalletClient {

    //...
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>
